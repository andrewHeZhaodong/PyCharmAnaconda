Install PyCharm and Anaconda on Windows

This tutorial is split into three sections. The first part is installing PyCharm. The second part is testing your installation (making a project, creating and running python files). Finally, the last part of the tutorial goes over installing packages, environment management, and java issues.

# Anaconda Installation
1. Download and install Anaconda (windows version) from:  
[Anaconda Download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads "Continuum Anaconda Windows Download")

2.Select the default options when prompted during the installation of Anaconda.

Note: If you checked this box, steps 4 and 5 are not needed. The reason why it isn’t preselected is a lot of people don’t have administrative rights on their computers.

3. After you finished installing, open Anaconda Prompt. Type the command below to see that you can use a Jupyter (IPython) Notebook.
# jupyter notebook

4. If you didn’t check the add Anaconda to path argument during the installation process, you will have to add python and conda to your environment variables. You know you need to do so if you open a command prompt (not anaconda prompt) and get the following messages:

5. Adding python and conda to your path (only choose 1 option).If you don’t know where your conda and/or python is, you type the following commands into your anaconda prompt:

You can add Python and Conda to your path by using the setx command in your command prompt.

6. Close the current command prompt and open a new one. Try typing python and conda in your command prompt to see if the paths are saved. Done!
