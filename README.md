Install PyCharm and Anaconda on Windows

This tutorial is split into three sections. The first part is installing PyCharm. The second part is testing your installation (making a project, creating and running python files). Finally, the last part of the tutorial goes over installing packages, environment management, and java issues.

# Installation
1. Download and install Anaconda (windows version) from:

2.Select the default options when prompted during the installation of Anaconda.

Note: If you checked this box, steps 4 and 5 are not needed. The reason why it isn’t preselected is a lot of people don’t have administrative rights on their computers.
